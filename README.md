To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding Web scraping, Backend and Frontend Development.

# The challenge
 Your challenge is scrape some product from etsy.com, save database and create an app which shows all products and products details.

# Where to find everything
 You can find frontend side in client folder. I used React and Bootstrap.

You can find backend side in server folder. I used Node.js   ,Express.js,MongoDb,Moongoose and Cheerio.js.

I created a script for web scrape in packege.json.When we call npm run seeder. It scrape products from etsy.com and it write product.json which located in data folder. After moongose get all products from product.json and insert mongodb.You can reach detail in seeder.js and scrape.js which located in utils.I used cheerio.js for scrape.

I use Docker for initializing the projects.
